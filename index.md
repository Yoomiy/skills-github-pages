# Your Name - Personal Website

# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yossi, a self-taught coder having fun building stuff. This little website is a side project I whipped up using GitHub Pages, inspired by ['s×”×ª×œ×ª×œ tweet] (https://x.com/taltimes2/status/1875879963393413514?mx=2). I'm really into learning new tech and exploring the world of development.

# What I'm Up To

Right now, I'm knee-deep in my final project for Harvard's CS50x. It's keeping me busy, but I'm super excited about how it's turning out. More on that soon!

# Quick Note About My GitHub

most of my repos are private right now. Sorry about that! I'm working on some stuff I'm actually proud to share, and I promise to make them public as soon as they're ready. Especially after I finish this CS50x thing, you'll see some action. ðŸ˜‰
